## 📝 FULL SCRIPT

**[0:00-0:10] Hook & Problem**

Hi, I'm [Founder Name], founder of Etelios. 

Indian SMEs are stuck using 5-10 different software tools to run their business - separate apps for HR, inventory, sales, accounting, and CRM. They're drowning in data silos, paying multiple subscriptions, and losing money on inefficiencies.

**[0:10-0:30] Solution**

Etelios is an AI-powered, multi-tenant ERP that replaces all of that with one unified platform. Think Zoho meets SAP, but built for Indian businesses - from optical stores to grocery chains.

We handle everything: HR, payroll, inventory with AI-powered ageing, sales, CRM, finance, and even prescription management for healthcare verticals. 

**[0:30-0:45] Differentiation & Traction**

What makes us different? We're multi-tenant SaaS from day one - one codebase serves thousands of businesses. We use AI for inventory forecasting, sales predictions, and automated workflows. And we're built for real-time operations - POS systems work offline and sync when connected.

We already have [X] customers, processing [Y] transactions monthly, with [Z]% month-over-month growth.

**[0:45-0:55] Market & Vision**

The Indian ERP market is $2.5 billion and growing at 20% annually. Most solutions are either too expensive or too basic. We're targeting the sweet spot - businesses that need enterprise features but at startup-friendly pricing.

**[0:55-1:00] Ask**

We're raising $1.5M to scale to 10,000 customers in the next 18 months. YC's network and mentorship would accelerate our growth in India's massive SME market.

Thank you.
